<span style="text-decoration:underline">In this tutorial we showcase how to use **MetaProViz**</span>:\
`-` To process raw peak data and identify outliers.\
`-` To perform differential metabolite analysis (DMA) to generate Log2FC and statistics and perform pathway analysis using Over Representation Analysis (ORA) on the results.\
`-` To do metabolite clustering analysis (MCA) to find clusters of metabolites with similar behaviors and perform pathway analysis using ORA on each cluster.\
`-` To use specific visualizations to aid biological interpretation of the results.\

# 1. Loading the example data

<div class="progress progress-striped active">
  <div class="progress-bar progress-bar-success" style="width: 100%"></div>
</div>

Here we choose an example datasets, which is publicly available on [metabolomics workbench project PR001418](https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/data/DRCCMetadata.php?Mode=Project&ProjectID=PR001418) including metabolic profiles of human renal epithelial cells HK2 and cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cell lines cultured in Plasmax cell culture media. Here we use the integrated raw peak data as example data using the trivial metabolite name in combination with the KEGG ID as the metabolite identifiers.\
\
<span style="text-decoration:underline">As part of the **MetaProViz** package you can load the example data into your global environment using the function `toy_data()`</span>:\
\
`1.` CoRe experiment **(CoRe)** \
The raw data are available via [metabolomics workbench study ST002226](https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/data/DRCCMetadata.php?Mode=Study&StudyID=ST002226&StudyType=MS&ResultType=1) were exometabolomics of HK2 and ccRCC cell lines 786-O, 786-M1A, 786-M2A, OS-RC-2, OS-LM1 and RFX-631 were performed.\
```{r}
MetaProViz::toy_data(data="CoRe")

# Check how our data looks like:
knitr::kable(Media[6:12, 1:8], caption = "Preview of the DF `CoRe` including columns with sample information and metabolite ids with their measured values.")
```
\
We will split the experimental data into the sample information and the metabolites values using the the column "Code" as the unique identifier:
```{r}
Media_M <- Media[1:39,-c(2:6)]%>%
  column_to_rownames("Code")

SampleInfo <-Media[c(1:39),c(1:6)]%>%
  column_to_rownames("Code")

```
\
`2.` Additional information mapping the trivial metabolite names to KEGG IDs and selected pathways **(MappingInfo)** \
```{r}
MetaProViz::toy_data(data="MappingInfo")

# Check how our data looks like:
knitr::kable(MappingInfo[1:5,], caption = "Preview of the DF `Pathways` including the trivial metabolite identifiers used in the experiment as well as KEGG IDs and pathway information.")
```
\
`3.` KEGG pathways that are loaded via KEGG API using the package `KEGGREST` and can be used to perform pathway analysis. **(KEGG_Pathways)**\
```{r}
#This will use KEGGREST to query the KEGG API to load the pathways:
MetaProViz::Load_KEGG()

# Check out how this looks:
knitr::kable(KEGG_Pathways[1:5,], caption = "Preview of the DF `KEGG_Pathways`.")

Currently, **MetaProViz** contains four different modules, which include different methods and can be used independently from each other or in combination (see introduction for more details). Here we will go trough each of those modules and apply them to the example data.

## Pre-processing
**MetaProViz** includes a pre-processing module with the function `Preprocessing()` that has multiple parameters to perform customize data processing.\
`Feature_Filtering` applies the 80%-filtering rule on the metabolite features either on the whole dataset (="Standard") (Bijlsma S. et al., 2006) or per condition (="Modified") (Yang, J et al., 2015). This means that metabolites are removed were more than 20% of the samples (all or per condition) have no detection. In case of the CoRe experiment, the blank samples are ignored during feature filtering, since often metabolites are released from a cell and not naturally present in the culture media leading to no detection in the blank. With the parameter `Feature_Filt_Value` we enable the adaptation of the stringency of the filtering based on the experimental context. For instance, patient tumour samples can contain many unknown subgroups due to gender, age, stage etc., which leads to a metabolite being detected in only 50% (or even less) of the tumour samples, hence in this context it could be considered to change the `Feature_Filt_Value` from the default (=0.8). If `Feature_Filtering = "None"`, no feature filtering is performed. In the context of `Feature_Filtering` it is also noteworthy that the function `Pool_Estimation()` can be used to estimate the quality of the metabolite detection and will return a list of metabolites that are variable across the different pool (mixture of all experimental samples measured several times during the LC-MS run) measurements and hence the quality of the detection is pool and hence the metabolite should be removed from the data.\
The parameter `TIC_Normalization` refers to Total Ion Count (TIC) normalization, which is often used with LC-MS derived metabolomics data. If `TIC_Normalization = TRUE`, each feature (=metabolite) in a sample is divided by the sum of all intensity value (= total number of ions)  for the sample and finally multiplied by a constant ( = the mean of all samples total number of ions). Noteworthy, TIC normalization should not be used with small number of features (= metabolites), since TIC assumes that on “average” the ion count of each sample is equal if there were no instrument batch effects (Wulff et. al., (2018)).\
The parameter `MVI` refers to Missing Value Imputation (MVI) and if `MVI = TRUE` half minimum (HM) missing value imputation is performed per feature (= per metabolite). Here it is important to mention that HM has been shown to perform well for missing vales that are missing not at random (MNAR) (Wei et. al., 2018 ,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-19120-0).\
Lastly, the function `Preprocessing()` performs outlier detection and adds a column "Outliers" into the DF, which can be used to remove outliers. The parameter `HotellinsConfidence` can be used to choose the confidence interval that should be used for the Hotellins T2 outlier test (Hotelling, H., 1931, doi:https://doi.org/10.1214/aoms/1177732979.).\

Notes on MVI: 
- Wei quantile regression imputation of left-censored data (QRILC) as performing best even though HM performs better in some of their tests and quantile normalization would not work well for normal distribution!
- Show MVI results with different percentages (not just 50% as per half minimum!) --> implement parameter for user to change?!
- Show that per feature imputation is advantageous over the "standard" imputation --> change standard to per feature!
- Check out QRILC and see if its the same as in  proDA (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/proDA.html) 
\
Since our example data contains pool samples, we will do `Pool_Estimation()` before applying the `Preprocessing()` function. This is important, since one should remove the features (=metabolites) that are too variable prior to performing any data transformations such as TIC as part of the `Preprocessing()` function.\
```{r}
#Get the Pool data:
PoolData <- MetaProViz::toy_data(data="CoRe")%>%
  subset(Conditions=="Pool", select = -c(2:6))# we remove the columns "Conditions", "Biological_Replicates", cell parameters

#--> remove features if needed.
```
\
Now we will apply the `Preprocessing()` function to example data and have a look at the output produced. You will notice that all the chosen parameters and results are documented in messages. All the results data tables, the Quality Control (QC) plots and outlier detection plots are returned to the global environment and can be easily viewed. Importantly, here we are able to specify that we have a CoRe experiment setting the parameter `CoRe=TRUE`, in which case a few additional data processing steps are applied:\
`1.` **Blank sample**: This refers to media samples where no cells have been cultured in, which will be used as blank. In detail, the mean of the blank sample of a feature (= metabolite) will be subtracted from the values measured in each sample for the same feature. In the column "Condition" of the Experimental_design DF, you will need to label your blank samples with "blank".\
`2.` **Growth factor** or **growth rate**: This refers to 
--> "CoRe_norm_factor" in your "Experimental_design" DF

\
```{r, eval=FALSE}
MetaProViz::Preprocessing(Input_data=Media_M,
                          Experimental_design=SampleInfo,
                          Feature_Filtering = "Modified",
                          Feature_Filt_Value = 0.8,
                          TIC_Normalization = TRUE,# As we have raw data we will perform total ion count normalisation
                          MVI=TRUE, #We assume the values are not missing at random and perform half minimum missing value imputation
                          HotellinsConfidence = 0.99,# We perform outlier testing using 0.99 confidence intervall
                          ExportQCPlots = TRUE,
                          CoRe = TRUE) 

# Now we can have a look at the results table:
Media_Preprocessed <- PreProcessing_res[["Processed_data"]]

knitr::kable(Media_Preprocessed[6:12, 1:7]%>%rownames_to_column("Code"), caption = "Preview of the pre-processing results, which has an additional column `Outlier` including the results of Hotellins T2.", row.names=FALSE)

#Give the option to pass a name for the results, otherwise if run multiple analysis on the same day its overwritten!
#Remove blank from DF after substraction has been done!
#ignore blank samples for feature filtering per condition!
```
\
In the output table you can now see the column "Outliers" and for the Condition 786-M2A, we can see that based on Hotellin's T2 test, one sample was detected as an outlier in the first round of filtering.\
As part of the `Preprocessing()` function several plots are generated, returned to the environment and saved. Those include the `Outlier_Plots`, which we can further check for the outlier:\
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#For each Round of HotellinsT2 test three plots will be saved:
#1.PCA plot
P1 <- Outlier_Plots[[1]]
P1

#2.Screeplot
P2 <- Outlier_Plots[[2]]
P2
#3.Hotellins Outlier
P3 <- Outlier_Plots[[3]]
P3

################### 
#If there has been an outlier detected, it will be removed and the HotellinsT2 test is repeated. 
```
\
The QC plots `QC_Plots` include an PCA plot using the processed data and highlighting the outliers. Moreover, if one has provided information about biological replicates a second plot is generated highlighting the biological replicates, which would highlight if there is a batch effect.\
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# PCA plot
# 1. Marked Outliers:
Q1 <- QC_Plots[[1]]
Q1

#2. Marked Biological replicates:
#Q2 <- QC_Plots[[2]]
#Q2
```
\
As part of the **MetaProViz** visualization module one can easily customize the PCA plot and adapt color and shape for the information of interest. You can see more below for the `VizPCA()` function and generate some overview Heatmaps `VizHeatmap().
\
Before we proceed, we will remove the outlier:\
```{r, eval=FALSE}
Media_Preprocessed <- Media_Preprocessed[-29,]#remove MS55_29
```
\
In metabolomics, sometimes samples are injected (=measured) several times, which can be termed as analytical replicates. The **MetaProViz** pre-processing module includes the function `ReplicateSum()`, which will summarise those save the results.

## DMA
Differential Metabolite Analysis (`DMA`) between two conditions (e.g. Tumour versus Healthy) calculates the Log2FC, p-value, adjusted p-value and t-value. With the different parameters of the `DMA()` function one can choose the statistical tests to calculate the p-value and adjusted p-value (parameters `STAT_pval` and `STAT_padj`).\
As input we will use the  pre-processed data we have generated using the `Preprocessing` module, but here one can of course use any DF including metabolite values and information about the conditions that should be compared (even though we recommend to normalize the data and remove outliers prior to DMA). Noteworthy, if you have not performed missing value imputation and hence your data includes NAs or 0 values for some features, this will be taken into account in the `DMA()` function:\
`1.` If all values of the replicates of one condition are NA/0 for a feature (=metabolite): Log2FC= Inf/-Inf and the statistics will be NA\
`2.` If some values  of the replicates of one condition are NA/0 for a feature (=metabolite): Log2FC= positive or negative value, but the statistics will be NA\
\
Important: For CoRe, we have negative and positive values! --> explain how we deal with them!


In the example data we have four different cell lines, healthy (HK2) and cancer (ccRCC: 786-M1A, 786-M2A and 786-O) and hence we can perform multiple different comparisons. The results are automatically saved and returned into the global environment. If parameter Plot=TRUE, an overview Volcano plot is generated and saved.\
