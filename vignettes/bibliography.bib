Various methods have been applied for handling missing values, but the selection can significantly affect following data analyses. Typically, there are three types of missing values, missing not at random (MNAR), missing at random (MAR), and missing completely at random (MCAR). Our study comprehensively compared eight imputation methods (zero, half minimum (HM), mean, median, random forest (RF), singular value decomposition (SVD), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and quantile regression imputation of left-censored data (QRILC)) for different types of missing values using four metabolomics datasets. Normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) and NRMSE-based sum of ranks (SOR) were applied to evaluate imputation accuracy. Principal component analysis (PCA)/partial least squares (PLS)-Procrustes analysis were used to evaluate the overall sample distribution. Student’s t-test followed by correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects on univariate statistics. Our findings demonstrated that RF performed the best for MCAR/MAR and QRILC was the favored one for left-censored MNAR. Finally, we proposed a comprehensive strategy and developed a public-accessible web-tool for the application of missing value imputation in metabolomics ( https://metabolomics.cc.hawaii.edu/software/MetImp/ ).}, number={1}, journal={Scientific Reports}, author={Wei, Runmin and Wang, Jingye and Su, Mingming and Jia, Erik and Chen, Shaoqiu and Chen, Tianlu and Ni, Yan}, year={2018}, month={Jan}, pages={663}}

All samples were analyzed by a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) lipidomic method for metabolic profiling. A pragmatic approach combining several well-established statistical methods was developed for processing this large data set in order to detect small differences in metabolic profiles in combination with a large biological variation. Such metabolomics studies require a careful analytical and statistical protocol. The strategy included data preprocessing, data analysis, and validation of statistical models. After several data preprocessing steps, partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was used for finding biomarkers. To validate the found biomarkers statistically, the PLS-DA models were validated by means of a permutation test, biomarker models, and noninformative models. Univariate plots of potential biomarkers were used to obtain insight in up- or downregulation.

However, the exact impact of specific metabolic changes on cancer progression is poorly understood. Here, we integrate multimodal analyses of primary and metastatic clonally-related clear cell renal cancer cells (ccRCC) grown in physiological media to identify key stage-specific metabolic vulnerabilities. We show that a VHL loss-dependent reprogramming of branched-chain amino acid catabolism sustains the de novo biosynthesis of aspartate and arginine enabling tumor cells with the flexibility of partitioning the nitrogen of the amino acids depending on their needs. Importantly, we identify the epigenetic reactivation of argininosuccinate synthase (ASS1), a urea cycle enzyme suppressed in primary ccRCC, as a crucial event for metastatic renal cancer cells to acquire the capability to generate arginine, invade in vitro and metastasize in vivo. Overall, our study uncovers a mechanism of metabolic flexibility occurring during ccRCC progression, paving the way for the development of novel stage-specific therapies.<br><br>© 2022.

Given the subsequent tumour and inter-patient heterogeneity, drug-based treatments report limited success, calling for multi-omics studies to extract regulatory relationships, and ultimately, to develop targeted therapies. Yet, methods for multi-omics integration to reveal mechanisms of phenotype regulation are lacking.<br><br><strong>METHODS:</strong> Here, we present SiRCle (Signature Regulatory Clustering), a method to integrate DNA methylation, RNA-seq and proteomics data at the gene level by following central dogma of biology, i.e. genetic information proceeds from DNA, to RNA, to protein. To identify regulatory clusters across the different omics layers, we group genes based on the layer where the gene’s dysregulation first occurred. We combine the SiRCle clusters with a variational autoencoder (VAE) to reveal key features from omics’ data for each SiRCle cluster and compare patient subpopulations in a ccRCC and a PanCan cohort.<br><br><strong>RESULTS:</strong> Applying SiRCle to a ccRCC cohort, we showed that glycolysis is upregulated by DNA hypomethylation, whilst mitochondrial enzymes and respiratory chain complexes are translationally suppressed. Additionally, we identify metabolic enzymes associated with survival along with the possible molecular driver behind the gene’s perturbations. By using the VAE to integrate omics’ data followed by statistical comparisons between tumour stages on the integrated space, we found a stage-dependent downregulation of proximal renal tubule genes, hinting at a loss of cellular identity in cancer cells. We also identified the regulatory layers responsible for their suppression. Lastly, we applied SiRCle to a PanCan cohort and found common signatures across ccRCC and PanCan in addition to the regulatory layer that defines tissue identity.<br><br><strong>CONCLUSIONS:</strong> Our results highlight SiRCle’s ability to reveal mechanisms of phenotype regulation in cancer, both specifically in ccRCC and broadly in a PanCan context.

@article{Farr_Dimitrov2024, title={MetalinksDB: a flexible and contextualizable resource of metabolite-protein interactions.}, DOI={10.1093/bib/bbae347}, abstractNote={From the catalytic breakdown of nutrients to signaling, interactions between metabolites and proteins play an essential role in cellular function. An important case is cell-cell communication, where metabolites, secreted into the microenvironment, initiate signaling cascades by binding to intra- or extracellular receptors of neighboring cells. Protein-protein cell-cell communication interactions are routinely predicted from transcriptomic data. However, inferring metabolite-mediated intercellular signaling remains challenging, partially due to the limited size of intercellular prior knowledge resources focused on metabolites. Here, we leverage knowledge-graph infrastructure to integrate generalistic metabolite-protein with curated metabolite-receptor resources to create MetalinksDB. MetalinksDB is an order of magnitude larger than existing metabolite-receptor resources and can be tailored to specific biological contexts, such as diseases, pathways, or tissue/cellular locations. We demonstrate MetalinksDB’s utility in identifying deregulated processes in renal cancer using multi-omics bulk data. Furthermore, we infer metabolite-driven intercellular signaling in acute kidney injury using spatial transcriptomics data. MetalinksDB is a comprehensive and customizable database of intercellular metabolite-protein interactions, accessible via a web interface (https://metalinks.omnipathdb.org/) and programmatically as a knowledge graph (https://github.com/biocypher/metalinks).

To address this challenge, here we use a combination of automated approaches and expert curation to develop a collection of “hallmark” gene sets as part of MSigDB. Each hallmark in this collection consists of a “refined” gene set, derived from multiple “founder” sets, that conveys a specific biological state or process and displays coherent expression.

We find that cancers undergo a tissue-specific metabolic rewiring, which converges towards a common metabolic landscape. Of note, downregulation of mitochondrial genes is associated with the worst clinical outcome across all cancer types and correlates with the expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition gene signature, a feature of invasive and metastatic cancers.
