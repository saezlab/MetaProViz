@article{Wei2018, title={Missing Value Imputation Approach for Mass Spectrometry-based Metabolomics Data.}, volume={8}, DOI={10.1038/s41598-017-19120-0}, abstractNote={Missing values exist widely in mass-spectrometry (MS) based metabolomics data. Various methods have been applied for handling missing values, but the selection can significantly affect following data analyses. Typically, there are three types of missing values, missing not at random (MNAR), missing at random (MAR), and missing completely at random (MCAR). Our study comprehensively compared eight imputation methods (zero, half minimum (HM), mean, median, random forest (RF), singular value decomposition (SVD), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and quantile regression imputation of left-censored data (QRILC)) for different types of missing values using four metabolomics datasets. Normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) and NRMSE-based sum of ranks (SOR) were applied to evaluate imputation accuracy. Principal component analysis (PCA)/partial least squares (PLS)-Procrustes analysis were used to evaluate the overall sample distribution. Student’s t-test followed by correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects on univariate statistics. Our findings demonstrated that RF performed the best for MCAR/MAR and QRILC was the favored one for left-censored MNAR. Finally, we proposed a comprehensive strategy and developed a public-accessible web-tool for the application of missing value imputation in metabolomics ( https://metabolomics.cc.hawaii.edu/software/MetImp/ ).}, number={1}, journal={Scientific Reports}, author={Wei, Runmin and Wang, Jingye and Su, Mingming and Jia, Erik and Chen, Shaoqiu and Chen, Tianlu and Ni, Yan}, year={2018}, month={Jan}, pages={663}}
@article{Bijlsma2006, title={Large-scale human metabolomics studies: a strategy for data (pre-) processing and validation.}, volume={78}, DOI={10.1021/ac051495j}, abstractNote={A large metabolomics study was performed on 600 plasma samples taken at four time points before and after a single intake of a high fat test meal by obese and lean subjects. All samples were analyzed by a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) lipidomic method for metabolic profiling. A pragmatic approach combining several well-established statistical methods was developed for processing this large data set in order to detect small differences in metabolic profiles in combination with a large biological variation. Such metabolomics studies require a careful analytical and statistical protocol. The strategy included data preprocessing, data analysis, and validation of statistical models. After several data preprocessing steps, partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was used for finding biomarkers. To validate the found biomarkers statistically, the PLS-DA models were validated by means of a permutation test, biomarker models, and noninformative models. Univariate plots of potential biomarkers were used to obtain insight in up- or downregulation. The strategy proposed proved to be applicable for dealing with large-scale human metabolomics studies.}, number={2}, journal={Analytical Chemistry}, author={Bijlsma, Sabina and Bobeldijk, Ivana and Verheij, Elwin R and Ramaker, Raymond and Kochhar, Sunil and Macdonald, Ian A and van Ommen, Ben and Smilde, Age K}, year={2006}, month={Jan}, pages={567–574}}
