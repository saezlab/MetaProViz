\
Tissue metabolomics experiment is a standard metabolomics experiment using tissue samples (e.g. from animals or patients).\
\
<span style="text-decoration:underline">In this tutorial we showcase how to use **MetaProViz**</span>:\

* To perform differential metabolite analysis (DMA) to generate Log2FC and statistics and perform pathway analysis using Over Representation Analysis (ORA) on the results.\
* To do metabolite clustering analysis (MCA) to find clusters of metabolites with similar behaviors based on patients demographics like age, gender and tumour stage.\
* Find the main metabolite drivers that separate patients based on their demographics like age, gender and tumour stage.\
\
First if you have not done yet, install the required dependencies and load the libraries:
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# 1. Loading the example data

\
Here we choose an example datasets, which is publicly available in the [paper](https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/comments/S1535-6108(15)00468-7#supplementaryMaterial) "An Integrated Metabolic Atlas of Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma", which includes metabolomic profiling on 138 matched clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)/normal tissue pairs. Metabolomics was done using The company Metabolon, so this is untargeted metabolomics. Here we use the median normalised data from the supplementary table 2 of the paper. We have combined the metainformation about the patients with the metabolite measurements and removed not identified metabolites. Lastly, we have added a column "Stage" where Stage1 and Stage2 patients are summarised to "EARLY-STAGE" and Stage3 and Stage4 patients to "LATE-STAGE". Moreover, we have added a column "Age", where patients with "AGE AT SURGERY" <42 are defined as "Young" and patients with AGE AT SURGERY >58 as "Old" and the remaining patients as "Middle".\

#<span style="text-decoration:underline">As part of the **MetaProViz** package you can load the example data into your global environment using the function `toy_data()`</span>:\
`1.` Tissue experiment **(Intra)** \
We can load the `ToyData`, which includes columns with Sample information and columns with the median normalised measured metabolite integrated peaks.\
```{r}
#Newer OmnipathR version needed than I have
# aaa.R (creates new environment) and zzz.R (.onLoad will be done when package is loaded)--> commom practice
#log and options (is the config file --> new configuration by using a parameter) connects them and can go into one file

devtools::load_all("C:/Users/chris/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/MetaProViz")

# Load the example data:
Tissue_Norm <- MetaProViz::ToyData("Tissue_Norm")

```
```{r, echo=FALSE}

## Pre-processing
This has been done by the authors of the paper and we will use the median normalized data. If you want to know how you can use the **MetaProViz** pre-processing module, please check out the vignette:\
- [Standard metabolomics data](https://saezlab.github.io/MetaProViz/articles/Standard%20Metabolomics.html)\
- [Consumption-Release (CoRe) metabolomics data from cell culture media](https://saezlab.github.io/MetaProViz/articles/CoRe%20Metabolomics.html)\

## Metadata analysis
We can use the patient's metadata to find the main metabolite drivers that separate patients based on their demographics like age, gender, etc.\
\
### Anova-based
Here the metdata analysis is based on principal component analysis (PCA), which is a dimensionality reduction method that reduces all the measured features (=metabolites) of one sample into a few features in the different principal components, whereby each principal component can explain a certain percentage of the variance between the different samples. Hence, this enables interpretation of sample clustering based on the measured features (=metabolites).\
The `MetaProViz::MetaAnalysis()` function will perform PCA to extract the different PCs followed by annova to find the main metabolite drivers that separate patients based on their demographics.\
\
Often a combination of demographics is is of paricular interest, e.g. comparing "Tumour versus Normal" for early stage patients and for late stage patients independently. If this is the case, we can use the parameter `SettingsInfo` and provide the column name of our main separator.\
```{r}
#Would it make sense here to separate tumour and normal for stage? --> meaning Normal-Stage1. Would this be useful for the other demographics too? --> e.g. Young-Stage1 
#If yes, should we enable the user to pass a primary separator and secondary separators?

MetaRes <- MetaProViz:::MetaAnalysis(InputData=Tissue_Norm[,-c(1:13)],
                                     SettingsFile_Sample= Tissue_Norm[,c(2,4:5,12:13)],
                                     #SettingInfo= c(MainSeparator = "TISSUE_TYPE), # enable this parameter in the function!
                                     Scaling = TRUE,
                                     Percentage = 0.1,
                                     SaveAs_Table = "csv",
                                     SaveAs_Plot = "svg",
                                     PrintPlot= TRUE,
                                     FolderPath = NULL)


```
\
Ultimately, this is leading to clusters of metabolites that are driving the separation of the different demographics.\

* Return it the other way around: having the metabolites as row names and than the demographics they separate in some sort of cluster column! --> biological regulatory clustering based on demographics! --> how to deal with metabolites targeting multiple demographics?\

```{r}
Test_Top <- MetaRes[["res_aov"]]%>%

                             strsplit(term, ", ")[[1]][which(strsplit(MainDriver, ", ")[[1]] == "TRUE")[1]],
                             NA),
    # Extract the Sum(Explained_Variance) where MainDriver is TRUE
    `MainDriver_Sum(VarianceExplained)` = ifelse("TRUE" %in% strsplit(MainDriver, ", ")[[1]],
                                                 as.numeric(strsplit(`Sum(Explained_Variance)`, ", ")[[1]][which(strsplit(MainDriver, ", ")[[1]] == "TRUE")[1]]),
                                                 NA)
  ) %>%
  ungroup()

#Add input data to the results = measured values for each sample



#calculate Log2FC and p-value (t.test) for each metabolite comparing the demographics --> If one demographic paramteter like age has more than two options, we would need to do multiple comparison


#Set threshold on variance explained --> probably based on percentage of total!

```



```{r}

#select columns Tissue_norm that are in TissueTypeList if they exist

MetaProViz:::VizHeatmap(InputData = Input_Heatmap,
                       SettingsFile_Sample = Tissue_Norm[,c(1:13)],
                       SettingsInfo = c(color_Sample = list("AGE","STAGE", "TISSUE_TYPE", "GENDER", "RACE")),
                       Scale ="column",
                       PlotName = "MainDriver_RACE and MainDriver_Sum(VarianceExplained) >15")

MetaProViz::VizSuperplot(InputData = Input_Heatmap,
                       SettingsFile_Sample = Tissue_Norm[,c(1:13)],
                       SettingsInfo = c(Conditions="STAGE"))



```

*Issue in metadata white and White --> should be the same!

Now we can make individual heatmap of each demographic comparison of interest using the `MetaProViz::Heatmap()` function.\
```{r}

```

### Enrichment analysis-based

*we can make pathway file from metadata and use this to run enrichment analysis. 
*At the moment we can just make the pathways and we need to include a standard fishers exact test.
*Merge with function above?

*Advantage/disadvantage: Not specific - with annova PC we get granularity e.g. smoker-ExSmoker-PC5, whilst here we only get smoking in generall as parameter

## DMA
Here we use Differential Metabolite Analysis (`DMA`) to compare two conditions (e.g. Tumour versus Healthy) by calculating the Log2FC, p-value, adjusted p-value and t-value.\
For more information please see the vignette:\
- [Standard metabolomics data](https://saezlab.github.io/MetaProViz/articles/Standard%20Metabolomics.html)\
- [Consumption-Release (CoRe) metabolomics data from cell culture media](https://saezlab.github.io/MetaProViz/articles/CoRe%20Metabolomics.html)\
\
We will perform multiple comparisons based on the different patient demographics available:
1. Tumour versus Normal: All patients
2. Tumour versus Normal: Subset of `Early Stage` patients 
3. Tumour versus Normal: Subset of `Late Stage` patients
4. Tumour versus Normal: Subset of `Young` patients
5. Tumour versus Normal: Subset of `Old` patients
\
```{r}
#Prepare the different selections
EarlyStage <- Tissue_Norm%>%
  filter(STAGE== "EARLY-STAGE")
LateStage <- Tissue_Norm%>%
  filter(STAGE=="LATE-STAGE")
Old <- Tissue_Norm%>%
  filter(AGE=="Old")
Young <- Tissue_Norm%>%
  filter(AGE=="Young")

DFs <- list("TissueType"= Tissue_Norm,"EarlyStage"= EarlyStage, "LateStage"= LateStage, "Old"= Old, "Young"=Young)

#Run DMA
ResList <- list()
for(item in names(DFs)){
  #Get the right DF:
  InputData <- DFs[[item]]
  #Perform DMA
  message(paste("Running DMA for", item))
  TvN <- MetaProViz::DMA(InputData =  InputData[,-c(1:13)],
                   SettingsFile_Sample =  InputData[,c(1:13)],
                   SettingsInfo = c(Conditions="TISSUE_TYPE", Numerator="TUMOR" , Denominator = "NORMAL"),
                   PerformShapiro=FALSE) #The data have been normalized by the company that provided the results and include metabolites with zero variance as they were all imputed with the same missing value.
  #Add Results to list
  ResList[[item]] <- TvN
}


```
\
We can see from the different Volcano plots have smaller p.adjusted values and differences in Log2FC range.\
Here we can also use the VizVolcano to plot comparisons together on the same plot, such as Tumour versus normal of young and old patients:\
```{r}
#Early versus Late Stage
MetaProViz::VizVolcano(PlotSettings="Compare",
                       InputData=ResList[["EarlyStage"]][["DMA"]][["TUMOR_vs_NORMAL"]]%>%column_to_rownames("Metabolite"),
                       InputData2= ResList[["LateStage"]][["DMA"]][["TUMOR_vs_NORMAL"]]%>%column_to_rownames("Metabolite"),
                       ComparisonName= c(InputData="EarlyStage", InputData2= "LateStage"),
                       PlotName= "EarlyStage-TUMOR_vs_NORMAL compared to LateStage-TUMOR_vs_NORMAL",
                       Subtitle= "Results of DMA" )

# Young versus Old
MetaProViz::VizVolcano(PlotSettings="Compare",
                       InputData=ResList[["Young"]][["DMA"]][["TUMOR_vs_NORMAL"]]%>%column_to_rownames("Metabolite"),
                       InputData2= ResList[["Old"]][["DMA"]][["TUMOR_vs_NORMAL"]]%>%column_to_rownames("Metabolite"),
                       ComparisonName= c(InputData="Young", InputData2= "Old"),
                       PlotName= "Young-TUMOR_vs_NORMAL compared to Old-TUMOR_vs_NORMAL",
                       Subtitle= "Results of DMA" )
```
\
Here we can observe that Tumour versus Normal has lower signifcance values for the Young patients compared to the Old patients. This can be due to higher variance in the metabolite measurements from Young patients compared to the Old patients.\

## Biological regulated clustering
To understand which metabolites are changing independent of the patients age, hence only due to tumour versus normal, and which metabolites change independent of tumour versus normal, hence due to the different age, 
we can use the `MetaProViz::BiologicalRegulatedClustering()` function.\
```{r}


```


Now we can use this information to colour code our volcano plot:

Make individual volcano plots:
*Like the one from young versus old for dipeptides!

We can also use this information on the heatmap:


*Do we see that clustering somewhat matches with our assigned clusters?


### ORA using the DMA results
Check dipeptides for enrichment analysis per cluster


*Send users to enrichment vignette if there are interested in accessing and using metabolite prior knowledge for enrichmnet analysis.
