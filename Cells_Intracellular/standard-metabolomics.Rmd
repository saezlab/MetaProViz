A standard metabolomics experiment refers to intracellular extracts (e.g. cell or bacteria culture), to tissue samples (e.g. from animals or patients), to plasma samples (e.g. blood) and many other types of experimental setups.\
\
<span style="text-decoration:underline">In this tutorial we showcase how to use **MetaProViz**</span>:\

* to process raw peak data and identify outliers.\
* to perform differential metabolite analysis (dma) to generate Log2FC and statistics and perform pathway analysis using Over Representation Analysis (ORA) on the results.\
* to do metabolite clustering analysis (MCA) to find clusters of metabolites with similar behaviors and perform pathway analysis using ORA on each cluster.\
* to use specific visualizations to aid biological interpretation of the results.\

Here we choose an example datasets, which is publicly available on [metabolomics workbench project PR001418](https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/data/DRCCMetadata.php?Mode=Project&ProjectID=PR001418) including metabolic profiles of human renal epithelial cells HK2 and cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cell lines cultured in Plasmax cell culture media [@Sciacovelli_Dugourd2022]. Here we use the integrated raw peak data as example data using the trivial metabolite name in combination with the KEGG ID as the metabolite identifiers.\

# 2. Run MetaProViz Analysis

<div class="progress progress-striped active">

</div>

Currently, **MetaProViz** contains four different modules, which include different methods and can be used independently from each other or in combination (see introduction for more details). Here we will go trough each of those modules and apply them to the example data.

## Pre-processing
**MetaProViz** includes a pre-processing module with the function `Preprocessing()` that has multiple parameters to perform customize data processing.\
`Feature_Filtering` applies the 80%-filtering rule on the metabolite features either on the whole dataset (="Standard") [@Bijlsma2006] or per condition (="Modified") [@Wei2018].  This means that metabolites are removed were more than 20% of the samples (all or per condition) have no detection. With the parameter `Feature_Filt_Value` we enable the adaptation of the stringency of the filtering based on the experimental context. For instance, patient tumour samples can contain many unknown subgroups due to gender, age, stage etc., which leads to a metabolite being detected in only 50% (or even less) of the tumour samples, hence in this context it could be considered to change the `Feature_Filt_Value` from the default (=0.8). If `Feature_Filtering = "None"`, no feature filtering is performed. In the context of `Feature_Filtering` it is also noteworthy that the function `Pool_Estimation()` can be used to estimate the quality of the metabolite detection and will return a list of metabolites that are variable across the different pool measurements (pool = mixture of all experimental samples measured several times during the LC-MS run) . Variable metabolite in the pool sample should be removed from the data.\
The parameter `tic_Normalization` refers to total Ion Count (tic) normalisation, which is often used with LC-MS derived metabolomics data. If `tic_Normalization = TRUE`, each feature (=metabolite) in a sample is divided by the sum of all intensity value (= total number of ions)  for the sample and finally multiplied by a constant ( = the mean of all samples total number of ions). Noteworthy, tic normalisation should not be used with small number of features (= metabolites), since tic assumes that on “average” the ion count of each sample is equal if there were no instrument batch effects [@Wulff2018].\
The parameter `mvi` refers to Missing Value Imputation (mvi) and if `mvi = TRUE` half minimum (HM) missing value imputation is performed per feature (= per metabolite). Here it is important to mention that HM has been shown to perform well for missing vales that are missing not at random (MNAR) [@Wei2018].\
Lastly, the function `Preprocessing()` performs outlier detection and adds a column "Outliers" into the DF, which can be used to remove outliers. The parameter `hotellins_confidence` can be used to choose the confidence interval that should be used for the Hotellins T2 outlier test [@Hotelling1931].\
\
Since our example data contains pool samples, we will do `Pool_Estimation()` before applying the `Preprocessing()` function. This is important, since one should remove the features (=metabolites) that are too variable prior to performing any data transformations such as tic as part of the `Preprocessing()` function.\
It is worth mentioning that the Coefficient of variation (CV) is calculated by dividing the standard deviation (SD) by the mean. Hence CV depends on the SD, which in turn works for normally distributed data.\

                                                     cutoff_cv = 30)

                                                     metadata_info = c(PoolSamples = "Pool", Conditions="Conditions"),
                                                     cutoff_cv = 30)

                                                     metadata_info = c(PoolSamples = "Pool", Conditions="Conditions"),

  kableExtra::kbl(caption = "Preview of the Pool_Estimation result.") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria", font_size = 12)
```
\
The results from the `Pool_Estimation()` is a table that has the CVs. If there is a high variability, one should consider to remove those features from the data. For the example data nothing needs to be removed. If you have used internal standard in your experiment you should specifically check their CV as this would indicate technical issues (here valine-d8 and hippuric acid-d5).\
\
Now we will apply the `Preprocessing()` function to example data and have a look at the output produced. You will notice that all the chosen parameters and results are documented in messages. All the results data tables, the Quality Control (QC) plots and outlier detection plots are returned and can be easily viewed.\

# This is the results table:
Intra_Preprocessed <- PreprocessingResults[["DF"]][["Preprocessing_output"]]

  kableExtra::kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria", font_size = 12) #%>%
  #kableExtra::scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "200px")
```
\
In the output table you can now see the column "Outliers" and for the Condition 786-M2A, we can see that based on Hotellin's T2 test, one sample was detected as an outlier in the first round of filtering.\
As part of the `Preprocessing()` function several plots are generated  and saved. Additionally, the ggplots are returned into the list to enable further modifiaction using the ggplot syntax. These plots include plots showing the outliers for each filtering round and other QC plots.\
\
As part of the **MetaProViz** visualization module one can easily further customize the PCA plot and adapt color and shape for the information of interest. You can see more below for the `viz_pca()` function.
\
Before we proceed, we will remove the outlier:\
```{r}
Intra_Preprocessed <- Intra_Preprocessed%>%
  filter(Outliers=="no")#remove MS55_29
```
\
As you may have noticed, in this example dataset we have several biological replicates that where injected (=measured) several times, which can be termed as analytical replicates. The **MetaProViz** pre-processing module includes the function `replicate_sum()`, which will do this task and save the results:\
```{r}
Intra_Preprocessed <- MetaProViz::replicate_sum(data=Intra_Preprocessed[,-c(1:4)],
                                               metadata_sample=Intra_Preprocessed[,c(1:4)],
                                               metadata_info = c(Conditions="Conditions", Biological_Replicates="Biological_Replicates", Analytical_Replicates="Analytical_Replicates"))
```
\
Using the pre-processed data, we can now use the **MetaProViz** visualization module and generate some overview Heatmaps `viz_heatmap()` or PCA plots `viz_pca()`. You can see some examples below.

## DMA
Differential Metabolite Analysis (`dma`) is used to compare two conditions (e.g. Tumour versus Healthy) by calculating the Log2FC, p-value, adjusted p-value and t-value. With the different parameters `STAT_pval` and `STAT_padj` one can choose the statistical tests such as t.test, wilcoxon test, limma, annova, kruskal walles, etc. (see function reference for more information).\
As input one can use the  pre-processed data we have generated using the `Preprocessing` module, but here one can of course use any DF including metabolite values, even though we recommend to normalize the data and remove outliers prior to dma. Moreover, we require the `Input_metadata_sample` including the sample metadata with information which condition a sample corresponds to. Additionally, we enable the user to provide a `Plot_metadata_feature` containing the metadata for the features (metabolites), such as KEGG ID, pathway, retention time, etc.\
\
By defining the numerator and denominator as part of the `Input_metadata_info` parameter, it is defined which comparisons are performed:\
1. **one_vs_one** (single comparison): numerator="Condition1", denominator ="Condition2"\
2. **all_vs_one** (multiple comparison): numerator=NULL, denominator ="Condition"\
3. **all_vs_all** (multiple comparison): numerator=NULL, denominator =NULL (=default)\
\
Noteworthy, if you have not performed missing value imputation and hence your data includes NAs or 0 values for some features, this is how we deal with this in the `dma()` function:\
1. If you use the parameter `STAT_pval="lmFit"`, limma is performed. Limma does a baesian fit of the data and substracts Mean(Condition1 fit) - Mean(Condition2 fit). As such, unless all values of a feature are NA, Limma can deal with NAs.
2. Standard Log2FC: log2(Mean(Condition1)) - log2(Mean(Condition2))
    a. If all values of the replicates of one condition are NA/0 for a feature (=metabolite): Log2FC= Inf/-Inf and the statistics will be NA\
    b. If some values  of the replicates of one condition are NA/0 for a feature (=metabolite): Log2FC= positive or negative value, but the statistics will be NA\

It is important to mention that in case of `STAT_pval="lmFit"`, we perform log2 transformation of the data as prior to running limma to enable the calculation of the log2FC, hence do not provide log2 transformed data.\
\
Here, the example data we have four different cell lines, healthy (HK2) and cancer (ccRCC: 786-M1A, 786-M2A and 786-O), hence we can perform multiple different comparisons. The results can be automatically saved and all the results are returned in a list with the different data frames. If parameter Plot=TRUE, an overview Volcano plot is generated and saved.\

  kableExtra::kbl(caption = "2. Preview of the dma results for the comparison of 786-M1A versus HK2 cells.", row.names=FALSE) %>%

```
\
Using the dma results, we can now use the **MetaProViz** visualization module and generate further customized Volcano plots `viz_volcano()`. You can see some examples below.

### ORA using the dma results
Over Representation Analysis (ORA) is a pathway enrichment analysis (PEA) method that determines if a set of features (=metabolic pathways) are over-represented in the selection of features (=metabolites) from the data in comparison to all measured features (metabolites) using the Fishers exact test. The selection of metabolites are usually the most altered metabolites in the data, which can be selected by the top and bottom t-values.\
Of course, there are many other PEA methods such as the well known GSEA. Here we do not aim to provide an extensive tool for different methods to perform pathway enrichment analysis and only focus on ORA since we can apply this to perform standard pathway enrichment as well as pathway enrichment on clusters of metabolites (see MCA below). If you are interested in using different pathway enrichment methods please check out specialized tools such as [decopupleR](https://saezlab.github.io/decoupleR/) [@Badia-I-Mompel2022].\
\
Here we will use the KEGG pathways [@Kanehisa2000]. Before we can perform ORA on the dma results, we have to ensure that the metabolite names match with the KEGG IDs or KEGG trivial names. In general, the `input_pathway` requirements are column "term", "Metabolite" and "Description", and the `Input_data` requirements are column "t.val" and column "Metabolite".\
```{r}
# Since we have performed multiple comparisons (all_vs_HK2), we will run ORA for each of this comparison
DM_ORA_res<- list()

comparisons <- names(DMA_Annova[["dma"]])
for(comparison in comparisons){
  #Ensure that the Metabolite names match with KEGG IDs or KEGG trivial names.
  dma <- DMA_Annova[["dma"]][[comparison]]
  dma <- dma[complete.cases(dma),-1]%>%#we remove metabolites that do not have a KEGG ID/KEGG pathway
  dplyr::rename("Metabolite"="KEGGCompound")#We use the KEGG trivial names to match with the KEGG pathways

  #Perform ORA
  DM_ORA_res[[comparison]] <- MetaProViz::standard_ora(data= dma%>%remove_rownames()%>%tibble::column_to_rownames("Metabolite"), #Input data requirements: column `t.val` and column `Metabolite`
                                                       metadata_info=c(pvalColumn="p.adj", percentageColumn="t.val", PathwayTerm= "term", PathwayFeature= "Metabolite"),
                                                       input_pathway=KEGG_Pathways,#Pathway file requirements: column `term`, `Metabolite` and `Description`. Above we loaded the Kegg_Pathways using MetaProViz::Load_KEGG()
                                                       pathway_name="KEGG",
                                                       min_gssize=3,
                                                       max_gssize=1000,
                                                       cutoff_stat=0.01,
                                                       cutoff_percentage=10)


}

# Lets check how the results look like:
DM_ORA_786M1A_vs_HK2 <- DM_ORA_res[["786-M1A_vs_HK2"]][["ClusterGosummary"]]
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Check how our data looks like:
DM_ORA_786M1A_vs_HK2[c(1:5),-1]%>%
  kableExtra::kbl(caption = "Preview of the ORA results for the comparison of 786-M1A versus HK2 cells.", row.names=FALSE) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria", font_size = 12)
```

## MCA
Metabolite Clustering Analysis (`MCA`) is a module, which includes different functions to enable clustering of metabolites into groups either based on logical regulatory rules. This can be particularly useful if one has multiple conditions and aims to find patterns in the data.

### MCA-2Cond
This metabolite clustering method is based on the Regulatory Clustering method (RCM) that was developed as part of the Signature Regulatory Clustering (SiRCle) model (@Mora_Schmidt2024). As part of the [SiRCleR package](https://github.com/ArianeMora/SiRCleR/tree/main), also variation of the initial RCM method are proposed as  clustering based on two comparisons (e.g. KO versus WT in hypoxia and in normoxia).\
Here we set two different thresholds, one for the differential metabolite abundance (`Log2FC`) and one for the `significance` (e.g. p.adj). This will define if a feature (= metabolite) is assigned into:\
1. ***"UP"***, which means a metabolite is significantly up-regulated in the underlying comparison.\
2. ***"DOWN"***,  which means a metabolite is significantly down-regulated in the underlying comparison.\
3. ***"No Change"***, which means a metabolite does not change significantly in the underlying comparison and/or is not defined as up-regulated/down-regulated based on the Log2FC threshold chosen.\
\
Therebye “No Change” is further subdivided into four states:\
1. ***“Not Detected”***, which means a metabolite is not detected in the underlying comparison.\
2. ***“Not Significant”***, which means a metabolite is not significant in the underlying comparison.\
3. ***“Significant positive”***, which means a metabolite is significant in the underlying comparison and the differential metabolite abundance is positive, yet does not meet the threshold set for "UP" (e.g. Log2FC >1 = "UP" and we have a significant Log2FC=0.8).\
4. ***“Significant negative”***, which means a metabolite is significant in the underlying comparison and the differential metabolite abundance is negative, yet does not meet the threshold set for "DOWN".\
\
This definition is done individually for each comparison and will impact in which metabolite cluster a metabolite is sorted into. \
Since we have two comparisons, we can choose between different Background settings, which defines which features will be considered for the clusters (e.g. you could include only features (= metabolites) that are detected in both comparisons, removing the rest of the features).The background methods `method_background` are the following from ***1.1. - 1.4.*** from most restrictive to least restrictive:\
***1.1. C1&C2***: Most stringend background setting and will lead to a small number of metabolites.\
***1.2. C1***: Focus is on the metabolite abundance of Condition 1 (C1).\
***1.3. C2***: Focus is on the metabolite abundance of Condition 2 (C2).\
***1.4. C1|C2***: Least stringent background method, since a metabolite will be included in the input if it has been detected on one of the two conditions.\
\
Lastly, we will get clusters of metabolites that are defined by the metabolite change in the two conditions. For example, if Alanine is "UP" based on the thresholds in both comparisons it will be sorted into the cluster "core_UP". As there are two 6-state6 transitions between the comparisons, the flows are summarised into smaller amount of metabolite clusters using different Regulation Groupings (RG):
1. RG1_All\
2. RG2_Significant taking into account genes that are significant (UP, DOWN, significant positive, significant negative)\
3. RG3_SignificantChange only takes into account genes that have significant changes (UP, DOWN).\
\
```{r}
# Example of all possible flows:
MCA2Cond_Rules <- mca_twocond_rules
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Check how our data looks like:
MCA2Cond_Rules%>%
  kableExtra::kbl(caption ="Metabolite Clustering Analysis: 2 Conditions.", row.names=FALSE) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria", font_size = 12)

# easyalluvial::alluvial_wide(mca_2cond[,c(1:2,4)], fill_by = 'last_variable' )
# easyalluvial::alluvial_wide(mca_2cond[,c(1:2,5)], fill_by = 'last_variable' )
```
\
Now let's use the data and do clustering:
```{r}
MCAres <-  MetaProViz::mca_2cond(data_c1=DMA_Annova[["dma"]][["786-O_vs_HK2"]],
                                 data_c2=DMA_Annova[["dma"]][["786-M1A_vs_HK2"]],
                                 metadata_info_c1=c(ValueCol="Log2FC",StatCol="p.adj", cutoff_stat= 0.05, ValueCutoff=1),
                                 metadata_info_c2=c(ValueCol="Log2FC",StatCol="p.adj", cutoff_stat= 0.05, ValueCutoff=1),
                                 feature = "Metabolite",
                                 save_table = "csv",
                                 method_background="C1&C2",
                                 path=NULL)



# Check how our data looks like:
Clustersummary <- MCAres[["MCA_2Cond_summary"]]
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Check how our data looks like:
Clustersummary[-c(1:15),]%>%
  kableExtra::kbl(caption ="summary of MCA: 2 Conditions.", row.names=FALSE) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria", font_size = 12)
```

### ORA on each metabolite cluster
As explained in detail above, Over Representation Analysis (ORA) is a pathway enrichment analysis (PEA) method. As ORA is based on the Fishers exact test it is perfect to test if a set of features (=metabolic pathways) are over-represented in the selection of features (= clusters of metabolites) from the data in comparison to all measured features (all metabolites). In detail, `MC_ORA()` will perform ORA on each of the metabolite clusters using all metabolites as the background.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Check how our data looks like:
MappingInfo[1:6,]%>%
  kableExtra::kbl(caption ="Pathway Input for MetaProViz::MC_ORA.") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria", font_size = 12)
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
MC_ORA_result <- MetaProViz::cluster_ora(data=MCAres[["MCA_2Cond_Results"]]%>%tibble::column_to_rownames("Metabolite"),
                                         metadata_info=c(ClusterColumn="RG2_Significant",
                                                        BackgroundColumn="BG_method",
                                                        PathwayTerm= "Pathway", #This is the column name including the pathways names
                                                        PathwayFeature= "Metabolite"),
                                         remove_background=TRUE,
                                         input_pathway=MappingInfo%>%rownames_to_column("Metabolite"),
                                         pathway_name="KEGG",
                                         min_gssize=3,
                                         max_gssize=1000 ,
                                         save_table= "csv")
```

# 3. Run MetaProViz Visualisation
The big advantages of the `MetaProViz` visualization module is its flexible and easy usage, which we will showcase below and that the figures are saved in a publication ready style and format. For instance, the x- and y-axis size will always be adjusted for the amount of samples or features (=metabolites) plotted, or in the case of Volcano plot and PCA plot the axis size is fixed and not affected by figure legends or title. In this way, there is no need for many adjustments and the figures can just be dropped into the presentation or paper and are all in the same style.\
\
All the `VizPlotName()` functions are constructed in the same way. Indeed, with the parameter `Plot_metadata_info` the user can pass a named vector with information about the metadata column that should be used to customize the plot by colour, shape or creating individual plots, which will all be showcased for the different plot types. Via the parameter `Plot_SettingsFile` the user can pass the metadata DF, which can be dependent on the plot type for the samples and/or the features (=metabolites). In case of both the parameter is named `Plot_metadata_sample` and `Plot_metadata_feature`.\
\
In each of those Plot_Settings, the user can label color and/or shape based on additional information (e.g. Pathway information, Cluster information or other other demographics like gender). Moreover, we also enable to plot individual plots where applicable based on those MetaData (e.g. one plot for each metabolic pathway).\
For this we need a metadata table including information about our samples that could be relevant to e.g. color code:\
```{r}
MetaData_Sample <- Intra_Preprocessed[,c(1:2)]%>%
   mutate(Celltype = case_when(Conditions=="HK2" ~ 'Healthy',
                               Conditions=="786-O" ~ 'Primary Tumour',
                               TRUE ~ 'Metastatic Tumour'))%>%
   mutate(Status = case_when(Conditions=="HK2" ~ 'Healthy',
                               TRUE ~ 'Cancer'))
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Check how our data looks like:
MetaData_Sample%>%
  kableExtra::kbl(caption = "Metadata table including additional information about our Samples.") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria", font_size = 12)
```
\
Moreover, we can use MetaData for our features (=Metabolites), which we loaded with the `MappingInfo` and we can also add the information on which cluster a metabolite was assigned to in the `MetaProViz::MCA()` analysis above:\
```{r}
MetaData_Metab <-merge(MappingInfo%>%tibble::rownames_to_column("Metabolite"), MCAres[["MCA_2Cond_Results"]][,c(1, 14,15)], by="Metabolite", all.y=TRUE)%>%
  tibble::column_to_rownames("Metabolite")
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Check how our data looks like:
MetaData_Metab[c(3:4,6,24:26),]%>%
  kableExtra::kbl(caption = "Metadata table including additional information about the Metabolites.") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria", font_size = 12)
```
\
Noteworthy, here we can also use the KEGG pathways we used for the pathway analysis.

### PCA plots
Principal component analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction method that reduces all the measured features (=metabolites) of one sample into a few features in the different principal components, whereby each principal component can explain a certain percentage of the variance between the different samples. Hence, this enables interpretation of sample clustering based on the measured features (=metabolites).\
As mentioned above, PCA plots can be quite useful for quality control, but of course it offers us many more opportunities, which will be showcased here.\
\
As input, we need a DF that contains the samples as rownames and the features (=metabolites) as column names:\
```{r}
Input_PCA <- Intra_Preprocessed[,-c(1:5)]#remove columns that include Metadata such as cell type,...
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Check how our data looks like:
Input_PCA[,1:7]%>%
  kableExtra::kbl(caption = "Input_data for `MetaProViz::viz_pca()`, with samples as rownames and metabolites as column names.") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria", font_size = 12)
```
\
Now lets check out the standard plot:
```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.align="left", fig.width=6, fig.height=4.5, fig.cap="Figure: Standard Settings."}
MetaProViz::viz_pca(data=Input_PCA)
```
Next, we can interactively choose shape and color using the additional information of interest from our Metadata. Especially for complex data, such as patient data, it can be valuable to use different demographics (e.g. age, gender, medication,...) for this. First lets check if we have any batch effect by colour coding for the biological replicates, which would be the case if the replicates cluster together.\
```{r, fig.align="left", fig.width=6, fig.height=4.5, fig.cap="Figure: Do we have a batch effect?"}
MetaProViz::viz_pca(metadata_info= c(color="Biological_Replicates"),
                   metadata_sample = MetaData_Sample ,
                   data=Input_PCA,
                   plot_name = "Batch Effect")
```
Next, we can colour code for condition and use the biological replicates in the shape parameter:\
```{r, fig.align="left", fig.width=6, fig.height=4.5, fig.cap="Figure: Do the samples cluster for the conditions?"}
MetaProViz::viz_pca(metadata_info= c(color="Conditions", shape="Biological_Replicates"),
                   metadata_sample= MetaData_Sample,
                   data=Input_PCA,
                   plot_name = "Sample Conditions")
```
The different cell lines we have are either control or cancerous, so we can display this too. Here is becomes apparent that the cell status is responsible for 64% of the variance (x-axis). \
```{r, fig.align="left", fig.width=6, fig.height=4.5, fig.cap="Figure: Do the samples cluster for the Cell status?"}
MetaProViz::viz_pca(metadata_info= c(color="Status"),
                   metadata_sample= MetaData_Sample,
                   data=Input_PCA,
                   plot_name = "Sample Status")
```
We can separate the cancerous cell lines further into metastatic or primary. This shows us that this is separated on the y-axis and accounts for 30%of the variance.\
```{r, fig.align="left", fig.width=6, fig.height=4.5, fig.cap="Figure: Do the samples cluster for the Cell type?"}
MetaProViz::viz_pca(metadata_info= c(color="Celltype", shape="Status"),
                   metadata_sample= MetaData_Sample,
                   data=Input_PCA,
                   plot_name = "Cell type")
```
Lastly, its worth mentioning that one can also change many style parameters to customize the plot.

### Heatmaps
Clustered heatmaps can be useful to understand the patterns in the data, which will be showcased on different examples.\
As input, we need a DF that contains the samples as rownames and the features (=metabolites) as column names:\
```{r}
Input_Heatmap <-  Intra_Preprocessed[,-c(1:4)]#remove columns that include Metadata such as cell type,...
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Check how our data looks like:
Input_Heatmap[,1:7]%>%
  kableExtra::kbl(caption = "Input for `MetaProViz::viz_heatmap()`, with samples as rownames and metabolites as column names.") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria", font_size = 12)
```
\
Now we can generate an overview heatmap. Since we plot all metabolites the metabolite names are not plotted since this would get too crowded (You can enforce this by changing the parameter `enforce_featurenames = TRUE`).
```{r, fig.align="left", fig.cap="Overview heatmap."}
MetaProViz::viz_heatmap(data = Input_Heatmap,
                      plot_name = "Overview")
```
\
Here we can add as many sample metadata information as needed at the same time:\
```{r, fig.align="left", fig.cap="Colour for sample metadata."}
MetaProViz::viz_heatmap(data = Input_Heatmap,
                       metadata_sample = MetaData_Sample,
                       metadata_info = c(color_Sample = list("Conditions","Biological_Replicates", "Celltype", "Status")),
                      plot_name = "Colour Samples")
```
\
Moreover, we can also add metabolite metadata information:\
```{r, fig.align="left", fig.cap="Colour for metabolite metadata."}
# row annotation: Color for Metabolites
MetaProViz::viz_heatmap(data = Input_Heatmap,
                       metadata_sample = MetaData_Sample,
                       metadata_info = c(color_Metab = list("Pathway")),
                       metadata_feature =  MappingInfo,
                      plot_name = "Colour Metabolites")
```
\
Lastly, by generate individual plot for e.g. each pathway or the metabolite clusters by adding individual (`individual_Sample` or `individual_Metab`) to `Plot_metadata_info`. At the same time we can still maintain the metadata information for both, the samples and the metabolites. together this can help us to draw biological conclusions about the different pathways: Indeed, we can observe for the `D-Amino acid metabolism` many metabolites fall into the MCA-Cluster `core_DOWN`, meaning in comparison to HK2 cells we have a negative Log2FC for 786-O and 786-M1A.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# individual: One individual plot for each pathway, col annotation: Colour for samples
MetaProViz::viz_heatmap(data = Input_Heatmap,
                       metadata_sample = MetaData_Sample,
                       metadata_info = c(individual_Metab = "Pathway",
                                        color_Sample = list("Conditions","Biological_Replicates"),
                                        color_Metab = list("RG2_Significant")),
                       metadata_feature =  MetaData_Metab,
                      plot_name = "Pathway")
```
<div class="vscroll-plot">
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=9, fig.height=7.5, warning=FALSE, fig.align="left"}
MetaProViz::viz_heatmap(data = Input_Heatmap,
                       metadata_sample = MetaData_Sample,
                       metadata_info = c(individual_Metab = "Pathway",
                                        color_Sample = list("Conditions","Biological_Replicates"),
                                        color_Metab = list("RG2_Significant")),
                       metadata_feature =  MetaData_Metab,
                      plot_name = "Pathway")
```
</div>
\
\
\

### Superplots
Sometimes one might be interested to create individual plots for each metabolite to understand the differences between specific conditions. For this common plot types are bargraphs, boxplots or violin plots.
As input, we need a DF that contains the samples as rownames and the features (=metabolites) as column names:\
```{r}
Input_Superplot <-  Intra_Preprocessed[,-c(1:4)]#remove columns that include Metadata such as cell type,...
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Check how our data looks like:
Input_Superplot[,1:7]%>%
  kableExtra::kbl(caption = "Input for `MetaProViz::viz_superplot()`, with samples as rownames and metabolites as column names.") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria", font_size = 12)
```
We also need the Metadata as we will need to know which conditions to plot for together. If you have further information such as replicates or patient ID, we can use this for the colour of the plotted samples per condition as in the superplots style as described in by Lord et al [@Lord2020]. \
\
```{r, eval=FALSE}
MetaProViz::viz_superplot(data =Input_Superplot[,c(1:6)],#We just plot six metabolites
                                           metadata_sample =MetaData_Sample,
                                           metadata_info = c(Conditions="Conditions", Superplot = "Biological_Replicates"),
                                           plot_type = "Bar", #Bar, Box, Violin
                                           plot_conditions = c("HK2", "786-O", "786-M1A", "786-M2A"),#sets the order in which the samples should be plotted
                                           stat_comparison = list(c(1,2),c(1,4)))#Stat comparisons to be included on the plot

```

<div class="vscroll-plot">
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align="left", fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
MetaProViz::viz_superplot(data =Input_Superplot[,c(1:6)],#We just plot six metabolites

\
\
\
We can also change it to violin plots:
```{r, eval=FALSE}

### Volcano plot
In general,we have three different `Plot_Settings`, which will also be used for other plot types such as lollipop graphs.\
`1.` `"Standard"` is the standard version of the plot, with one dataset being plotted.\
`2.` `"Conditions"` here two or more datasets will be plotted together. How datasets can be plotted together depends on the plot type.\
`3.` `"PEA"` stands for Pathway Enrichment Analysis, and is used if the results of an GSE analysis should be plotted as here the figure legends will be adapted.\
\
Here we will look at all the different options we have to display our results from the different analysis (dma, PEA), which will help us to interpret our results as this can be sometimes difficult to do from the many data tables.\
Just a quick reminder, how the input data look like:\
1. Results of Differential Metabolite Analysis (dma): Log2FC and stats:\
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Check how our data looks like:
DMA_786M1A_vs_HK2[1:7,]%>%
  kableExtra::kbl(caption = "Input_data for `MetaProViz::viz_volcano()` are for example differential analysis results from `MetaProViz::dma()`.") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria", font_size = 12)
```
\
2. Results from Pathway Enrichment Analysis (PEA): Score (e.g. NES score) and stats\
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Check how our data looks like:
DM_ORA_res[["786-M1A_vs_HK2"]][["ClusterGosummary"]][1:4,-c(1,7)]%>%
  kableExtra::kbl(caption = "Input_data for `MetaProViz::viz_volcano()` are for example pathway enrichment results from `MetaProViz::DM_ORA()`.", row.names = FALSE) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria", font_size = 12)
```

#### **Standard**
Here we will first look into the results from the differential analysis (see section `dma` above) for the comparison of `786-M1A_vs_HK2`:
```{r, fig.align="left", fig.width=7, fig.height=5, fig.cap="Figure: Standard figure displaying dma results."}
# Run with default parameter --> only need to provide Input_data and the title we like
MetaProViz::viz_volcano(data=DMA_786M1A_vs_HK2%>%tibble::column_to_rownames("Metabolite"))
```
\
If you seek to plot the metabolite names you can change the paramter `select_label` from its default (`select_label=""`) to NULL and the metabolite names will be plotted randomly.
```{r, fig.align="left", fig.width=7, fig.height=5, fig.cap="Figure: Standard figure displaying dma results."}
# Run with default parameter --> only need to provide Input_data and the title we like
MetaProViz::viz_volcano(data=DMA_786M1A_vs_HK2%>%tibble::column_to_rownames("Metabolite"),
                       select_label = NULL)
```
\
With the parameter `select_label` you can also pass a vector with Metabolite names that should be labeled:
```{r, fig.align="left", fig.width=7, fig.height=5, fig.cap="Figure: Standard figure displaying dma results."}
# Run with default parameter --> only need to provide Input_data and the title we like
MetaProViz::viz_volcano(data=DMA_786M1A_vs_HK2%>%tibble::column_to_rownames("Metabolite"),
                       select_label = c("N-acetylaspartylglutamate", "cystathionine", "orotidine"))
```
\
Next we may be interested to understand which metabolite clusters based on our MCA the metabolites of the plot correspond to. In order to do this we can provide a Plot_SettingsFile with this additional information and use this information to color code and/or to shape the dots on the volcano plot. In order to choose the right column we need to provide a vector Plot_metadata_info with this information.\
```{r, fig.align="left", fig.width=7, fig.height=5, fig.cap="Figure: Standard figure displaying dma results colour coded/shaped for metabolic clusters from MCA results."}

# Now we need to add our Plot_SettingsFile and the Plot_metadata_info:
MetaProViz::viz_volcano(plot_types="Standard",
                        metadata_info= c(color="RG2_Significant"),
                        metadata_feature= MetaData_Metab,
                        data=DMA_786M1A_vs_HK2%>%tibble::column_to_rownames("Metabolite"),
                        plot_name= "786M1A versus HK2",
                        subtitle= "Results of dma. Colour coded for metabolic clusters" )

# If we want to use the shape instead of the colour for the cluster info, we can just change our Plot_metadata_info
MetaProViz::viz_volcano(plot_types="Standard",
                        metadata_info= c(shape="RG2_Significant"),
                        metadata_feature= MetaData_Metab,
                        data=DMA_786M1A_vs_HK2%>%tibble::column_to_rownames("Metabolite"),
                        plot_name= "786M1A versus HK2",
                        subtitle= "Results of dma. Shape for metabolic clusters, color for significance." )

# Of course, we can also adapt both, color and shape for the same parameter:
MetaProViz::viz_volcano(plot_types="Standard",
                        metadata_info= c(shape="RG2_Significant", color="RG2_Significant"),
                        metadata_feature= MetaData_Metab,
                        data=DMA_786M1A_vs_HK2%>%tibble::column_to_rownames("Metabolite"),
                        plot_name= "786M1A versus HK2",
                        subtitle= "Results of dma. Shape and color for metabolic clusters." )
```
\
Given that we also know, which metabolic pathway the metabolites correspond to, we can add this information into the plot. This is also a good example to showcase the flexibility of the visualisation function: Either you use the parameter `Plot_SettingsFile= MetaData_Metab` as above, but as we have the column "Pathway" also in our Input_data you can also pass `Plot_SettingsFile= DMA_786-M1A_vs_HK2` or simply use the default `Plot_SettingsFile=NULL`, in which case the `Plot_metadata_info` information (here `color`) will be used from Input_data. \
```{r, fig.align="left", fig.width=7, fig.height=5, fig.cap="Figure: Standard figure displaying dma results colour coded for metabolic pathways and shaped for metabolic clusters from MCA results."}
# Now we can use color for the pathways and shape for the metabolite clusters:
MetaProViz::viz_volcano(plot_types="Standard",
                        metadata_info= c(color="Pathway"),
                        metadata_feature= MappingInfo,
                        data=DMA_786M1A_vs_HK2%>%tibble::column_to_rownames("Metabolite"),
                        plot_name= "786M1A versus HK2 Results of dma. Colour for metabolic pathways.",
                        subtitle= "Results of dma. Colour for metabolic pathways." )
```
\
We immediately see that there are many pathways displayed on the plot, which can make it difficult to interpret. Hence, we will change our plot settings in order to get individual plots for each of the pathways:
```{r Display_Not_Run, eval=FALSE}
# Now we can generate a plot for each pathway and color for the metabolite clusters:
MetaProViz::viz_volcano(plot_types="Standard",
                        metadata_info= c(color="RG2_Significant", individual="Pathway"),
                        metadata_feature= MetaData_Metab,
                        data=DMA_786M1A_vs_HK2%>%tibble::column_to_rownames("Metabolite"),
                        plot_name= "786M1A versus HK2",
                        subtitle= "Results of dma. Colour for metabolic pathways." )
```

<div class="vscroll-plot">
```{r Run_not_Display, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align="left", fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
# Now we can generate a plot for each pathway and color for the metabolite clusters:
MetaProViz::viz_volcano(plot_types="Standard",
                        metadata_info= c(color="RG2_Significant", individual="Pathway"),
                        metadata_feature= MetaData_Metab,
                        data=DMA_786M1A_vs_HK2%>%tibble::column_to_rownames("Metabolite"),
                        plot_name= "786M1A versus HK2",
                        subtitle= "Results of dma. Colour for metabolic pathways." )

```
</div>
\
\
\

#### **Comparison**
```{r, fig.align="left", fig.width=7, fig.height=5, fig.cap="Figure: Comparison."}
MetaProViz::viz_volcano(plot_types="Compare",
                        data=DMA_786M1A_vs_HK2%>%tibble::column_to_rownames("Metabolite"),
                        data2= DMA_Annova[["dma"]][["786-O_vs_HK2"]]%>%tibble::column_to_rownames("Metabolite"),
                        name_comparison= c(data="786M1A_vs_HK", data2= "786-O_vs_HK2"),
                        plot_name= "786M1A vs HK2 compared to 7860 vs HK2",
                        subtitle= "Results of dma" )
```

Now we do individual plots again:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
MetaProViz::viz_volcano(plot_types="Compare",
                        metadata_info= c(individual="Pathway"),
                        metadata_feature= MappingInfo,
                        data=DMA_786M1A_vs_HK2%>%tibble::column_to_rownames("Metabolite"),
                        data2= DMA_Annova[["dma"]][["786-O_vs_HK2"]]%>%tibble::column_to_rownames("Metabolite"),
                        plot_name= "786M1A vs HK2 compared to 7860 vs HK2",
                        subtitle= "Results of dma" )
```

<div class="vscroll-plot">
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="left", fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
MetaProViz::viz_volcano(plot_types="Compare",
                        metadata_info= c(individual="Pathway"),
                        metadata_feature= MappingInfo,
                        data=DMA_786M1A_vs_HK2%>%tibble::column_to_rownames("Metabolite"),
                        data2= DMA_Annova[["dma"]][["786-O_vs_HK2"]]%>%tibble::column_to_rownames("Metabolite"),
                        plot_name= "786M1A vs HK2 compared to 7860 vs HK2",
                        subtitle= "Results of dma" )

```
</div>
\
\

#### **PathwayEnrichmentAnalysis**
If you have performed Pathway Enrichment Analysis (PEA) such as ORA or GSEA, we can also plot the results and add the information into the Figure legends.\
For this we need to prepare the correct input data including the pathways used to run the pathway analysis, the differential metabolite data used as input for the pathway analysis and the results of the pathway analysis:
```{r}
# Prepare the Input:
# 1. data=Pathway analysis input: Must have features as column names. Those feature names need to match features in the pathway analysis file metadata_feature.
InputPEA <- DMA_786M1A_vs_HK2 %>%
  filter(!is.na(KEGGCompound)) %>%
  tibble::column_to_rownames("KEGGCompound")

# 2. data2=Pathway analysis output: Must have same column names as metadata_feature for Pathway name
InputPEA2 <- DM_ORA_786M1A_vs_HK2 %>%
  dplyr::rename("term"="ID")

# 3. metadata_feature= Pathways used for pathway analysis: Must have same column names as metadata_feature for Pathway name and feature names need to match features in the data. PEA_Feature passes this column name!

```
\
Now we can produce the plots:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
MetaProViz::viz_volcano(plot_types="PEA",
                       metadata_info= c(PEA_Pathway="term",# Needs to be the same in both, metadata_feature and data2.
                                       PEA_stat="p.adjust",#Column data2
                                       PEA_score="GeneRatio",#Column data2
                                       PEA_Feature="Metabolite"),# Column metadata_feature (needs to be the same as row names in data)
                       metadata_feature= KEGG_Pathways,#Must be the pathways used for pathway analysis
                       data= InputPEA, #Must be the data you have used as an input for the pathway analysis
                       data2= InputPEA2, #Must be the results of the pathway analysis
                       plot_name= "KEGG",
                       subtitle= "PEA" ,
                       select_label = NULL)
```

<div class="vscroll-plot">
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align="left", fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
MetaProViz::viz_volcano(plot_types="PEA",
                       metadata_info= c(PEA_Pathway="term",# Needs to be the same in both, metadata_feature and data2.
                                       PEA_stat="p.adjust",#Column data2
                                       PEA_score="GeneRatio",#Column data2
                                       PEA_Feature="Metabolite"),# Column metadata_feature (needs to be the same as row names in data)
                       metadata_feature= KEGG_Pathways,#Must be the pathways used for pathway analysis

                       data2= InputPEA2,#Must be the results of the pathway analysis
                       plot_name= "KEGG",
                       subtitle= "PEA" ,
                       select_label = NULL)
```
