\usage{
Vizsuperplot(
  Input_data,
  Plot_SettingsFile,
  Plot_SettingsInfo = c(conditions = "Conditions", superplot = NULL),
  Graph_Style = "Box",
  OutputPlotName = "",
  Selected_Conditions = NULL,
  Selected_Comparisons = NULL,
  Individual_plots = FALSE,
  Theme = theme_classic(),
  color_palette = NULL,
  Save_as_Plot = "svg"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Input_data}{DF with unique sample identifiers as row names and metabolite numerical values in columns with metabolite identifiers as column names. Includes experimental design and outlier column.}

\item{Plot_SettingsFile}{DF which contains information about the samples, which will be combined with your input data based on the unique sample identifiers used as rownames. Column "Conditions" with information about the sample conditions (e.g. "N" and "T" or "Normal" and "Tumor"), can be used for feature filtering and colour coding in the PCA. Column "AnalyticalReplicate" including numerical values, defines technical repetitions of measurements, which will be summarised. Column "BiologicalReplicates" including numerical values. Please use the following names: "Conditions", "Biological_Replicates", "Analytical_Replicates".}

\item{Plot_SettingsInfo}{Named vector including at least information on the conditions column: c(conditions="ColumnName_Plot_SettingsFile"). Additionally superplots can be made by adding superplot ="olumnName_Plot_SettingsFile", which are ususally biological replicates or patient IDs. \strong{Default = c(conditions="Conditions", superplot = NULL)}}

\item{Graph_Style}{String with the information of the Graph style. Available options are Bar. Box and Violin  \strong{Default = Box}}

\item{Selected_Conditions}{Vector with names of selected Conditions for the plot. \strong{Default = NULL}}

\item{Selected_Comparisons}{List of numeric vectors containing Condition pairs to compare based on the order of the Selected_Conditions vector. \strong{Default = NULL}}

\item{Individual_plots}{\emph{Optional: }  Logical, TRUE to save each plot individually. \strong{Default = FALSE}}

\item{Theme}{\emph{Optional: } Selection of theme for plot. \strong{Default = theme_classic}}

\item{color_palette}{\emph{Optional: } Provide customized color-color_palette in vector format. \strong{Default = NULL}}

\item{Save_as_Plot}{\emph{Optional: } Select the file type of output plots. Options are svg, pdf, png or NULL. \strong{Default = svg}}

\item{Output_Name}{\emph{Optional: } String which is added to the output files of the plot.}
