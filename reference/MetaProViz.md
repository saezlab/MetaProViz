# The MetaProViz package

MetaProViz (Metabolomics Processing, functional analysis and
Visualization), a free open-source R-package that provides mechanistic
hypotheses from metabolomics data by integrating prior knowledge from
literature with metabolomics. MetaProViz offers an interactive framework
consisting of five modules: Processing, differential analysis, prior
knowledge access and refactoring, functional analysis and visualization
of both intracellular and exometabolomics (consumption-release/core
data).
